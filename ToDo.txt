Conversions functions needed:

-Dollars to Cents...done!
-Gallons to Liters
-Hours to Minutes...done!
-Feet to Rnches
-Degrees to Radians

#there is going to be some implementation of the code. 
Implemention

Probably better to write different functions for each conversion,
instead of handling all conversions in a single function
