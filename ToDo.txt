Conversions functions needed:

-Dollars to Cents...done!
-Gallons to Liters  ..done!
-Hours to Minutes...done!
-Feet to Inches...done!
-Degrees to Radians..done!

#there is going to be some implementation of the code. 
Implemention

Probably better to write different functions for each conversion,
instead of handling all conversions in a single function
